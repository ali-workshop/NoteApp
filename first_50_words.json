{"text": "Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a young girl named Lily. She was always the only child that was born with the ability of creating magical things, and the only one who became a dragon. From then on, that girl was known as Lily Potter, and she was called \"The Dragon\" because that is what she was born with. Lily was a very good one, and she was known to have the ability of creating magical things and creating dragons. During her time with the school, she was always the one who brought the most magical things about the world. She was the one who gave birth to the little girl named Lily and the two of them even shared a kiss once more. She would often come to my house as usual and tell me about what she had done and said. I can't remember"}
